### Profile

I'm a computer nerd who wants to automate the world! I'm incredibly driven
and focused on learning as much as I possibly can.

------

### Skills

* Continuous Delivery
  : From 'new branch' to 'push to production' I get quality code where it needs to be,
  when it needs to be there.

* Linux 4 Life
  : I've been running at least one flavor of Linux for the past 15 years, Slackware
  at home, Ubuntu/RHEL derivatives at work. A day spent in a terminal is a day well
  spent

* Retail Experience
  : It may be hard to believe, but having worked in retail for a long time has uniquely
  equipped me with uncanny communication abilities.

### Experience

SmartBrief Inc., Washington, DC
: *Software Test Engineer*

  __June 2014 - Current__

  I built and actively maintain the continuous integration pipeline for a 25 person development
  team. This includes triggering automated tests by using mercurial hooks, alerting of test results
  to appropriate team members, social execution of build/test commands to increase awareness among
  our team, and automated deploy to QA environments. Before I started working at SmartBrief their
  deployment process was 100% manual. After 3 months SmartBrief I built a simple deployment
  system using Rundeck and some simple BASH scripts. The deployment system now saves about 550 hours per year that QA engineers would have normally spent manually rebuilding.

General Electric, Glen Allen, VA
: *Information Security Internship*

  __January 2013 - August 2013__

  I worked for GE as an intern for two semesters in 2013 at their Information Security Technology
  Center. During that time I built an emailrelay proxy project to allow firewall policy testing
  by various GE employees while keeping the firewall in a DMZ, and as a systems administrator
  for a Django/D3JS application to track intellectual property exfiltration by users uploading
  to Dropbox or Google drive.

H&M, Washington, DC
: *Operations Manager*

  __December 2006 - July 2010__

  I started as a department manager and focused on employee retention and employee recruitment.
  I was brought to multiple training sessions at the Herald Square location to then go back and
  train store managers in the DC area. I was brought up to operations manager during 2008 to
  assist in a project to get shipment processing down to the fewest people necessary while
  maintaining peak efficiency. I resigned and became part time while attending VCU.

### Education

Bachelor of Science in Information Systems
:
  *Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA*

  __Aug, 2010 - May 2014__

  Cumulative GPA of 3.125. Developed a continuous deployment system for senior year independent
  study project. I wrote an eCommerce dog walking service using a traditional LAMP stack for my
  senior capstone class.
